## Project Overview

This project develops a predictive machine learning model for Waze to identify users who are likely to **churn** (stop using the app) versus users who will be **retained** (continue using the app regularly).

### Project Background

Waze's free navigation app provides users with turn-by-turn directions and real-time traffic information. The app generates revenue through partnerships and advertising. High user retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time, which is crucial for maintaining advertising revenue and partnerships.

This project is part of a larger effort at Waze to increase user growth and retention. By developing an accurate churn prediction model, Waze can identify at-risk users early and implement targeted retention strategies to prevent churn, ultimately growing the business.

## Problem Statement

**Business Goal**: Identify users who are likely to churn so that Waze can implement targeted retention strategies to prevent user loss and improve overall user retention rates.

**Technical Goal**: Build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a user will:
- **Churn**: Stop using the Waze app (defined as no usage for a specific time period)
- **Retain**: Continue using the Waze app regularly

## Dataset

The dataset contains Waze user behavior data and engagement metrics including:
- User session information (sessions per month, total sessions)
- Drive behavior metrics (drives, driving duration)
- Device information (device type, operating system)
- User activity patterns (activity days, usage frequency)
- Navigation metrics (navigation usage, km driven)
- User demographics and account information
- Target variable: `label` (churn/retained)

### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Data Loading**: Load and inspect the Waze user dataset
2. **EDA**: Explore user behavior patterns and identify key differences between churned and retained users
3. **Preprocessing**: Clean data, handle missing values, and engineer relevant features
4. **Modeling**: Train and compare multiple machine learning algorithms
5. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance and identify most predictive features

## Model Performance 
*validation set*

| Model | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Random Forest | 85.2% | 96.2% | 90.4% | 89.8% |
| XGBoost | 84.9% | 96.2% | 90.1% | 89.6% |

**Best Model**: Random forest

### Key Insights

- **User Behavior Patterns**:
  - drivers using the app to known favorite locations impact churn prediction.
  - Retained users drive significantly more kilometers per day.
  - Churned users tend to have fewer active days and shorter session durations.
  - Users with higher navigation usage are more likely to be retained.
